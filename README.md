# Kubeadm on AWS

## Vision

Deploy kubeadm on AWS manually

## Mission

Create a fully repoducable guide outlining the manual steps

## FAQ

**Q:** Why kubeadm?

**A:** Goal is to get a minimal setup running which everyone can repoduce and undestand how it is setup.



**Q:** Why not go directly to a bare metal setup on AWS?

**A:** Kuebadm has already much covered for you regarding the installation process of the components and abstracts this further in an administration friendly way. It strikes a good midle point between comprehensive Kubernetes distributions and the bare metals setup
